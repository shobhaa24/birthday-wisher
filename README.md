This program helps in writing texts to different customers with different names by using only one format letter and reducing the work of changing names everytime you need to send to a different person.

This program at the end creates a number of letters to different people(names changed) but with the same body of the letter.
These get stored in a folder called "Output".

The list of names are mentioned in a file called, "invited_names.txt" and the body of the letter is in "starting_letter.txt"
